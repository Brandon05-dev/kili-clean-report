   ```bash
   npm install react-leaflet leaflet leaflet.markercluster
   ```

2. **Leaflet Component** (ready to implement):
   ```tsx
   <MapContainer center={[-1.2921, 36.7822]} zoom={13}>
     <TileLayer url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" />
     <MarkerClusterGroup>
       {reports.map(report => (
         <Marker position={[lat, lng]} icon={customIcon}>
           <Popup>{reportDetails}</Popup>
         </Marker>
       ))}
     </MarkerClusterGroup>
   </MapContainer>
   ```

3. **Custom Markers**: Status-based icons with clustering for nearby reports

### 📍 Advanced Location Features
